You are an expert in Lean 4 theorem proving. Your task is to select the BEST formalization to prove from multiple semantically aligned formalizations of the same informal statement.

**Informal Statement:**
{{ informal_statement }}

**Available Formalizations:**
{% for idx, formalization in formalizations %}
**Formalization {{ idx + 1 }}:**
```lean4
{{ formalization }}
```
{% endfor %}

**Instructions:**
1. Analyze each formalization carefully, considering:
   - Structural complexity
   - How many hypotheses need to be handled
   - Whether the formalization uses complex type theory constructs
   - Whether it requires proving stronger/more general results
   - Availability of library theorems that might help
   - How natural the proof approach would be
   - Avoid using too general definitions that are hard to compute. (e.g. `Euclidean.dist` in real space or general `Field` instead of `ℚ`.)
   - If the informal statement contains quantifiers, the formalization should also contain quantifiers.

2. The BEST formalization should be EASY to prove while maintaining the mathematical meaning of the informal statement.

3. Provide your analysis in the following format:
   - Wrap your reasoning in <analysis></analysis> tags
   - Specify the selected formalization number (1, 2, 3, etc.) in <selected>number</selected> tags

**Example Response Format:**
<analysis>
Your detailed reasoning about why you chose this formalization...
</analysis>
<selected>2</selected>
