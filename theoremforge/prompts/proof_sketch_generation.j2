You are a Lean 4 expert who is trying to help write a proof in Lean 4.

Problem Statement:
{{ formal_statement }}

Useful Theorems:
{{ useful_theorems }}

Informal Proof:
{{ informal_proof }}

Instructions:

Use the informal proof and useful theorems to write a proof sketch for the problem in Lean 4 following
these guidelines:
- Break complex reasoning into logical sub-goals using `have` statements.
- The subgoals should build up to prove the main theorem. Use `by sorry` for all subgoal proofs.
- Make sure to include all the steps and calculations from the given proof in the
  proof sketch.
- Each subgoal should ideally require applying just one key theorem or lemma, or a
  few tactic applications.
- If the given problem statement include definitions, the final proof sketch code should include the definitions.
- Do NOT create subgoals identical to any of the given hypotheses
- Do NOT create subgoals that are more complex than the original problems. The
  subgoals should be SIMPLER than the given problem.
- Do NOT skip over any steps. Do NOT make any mathematical leaps.

**IMPORTANT**: DO NOT provide complete proofs for the subgoals. Only provide the structure of the proof.

**Subgoal Structure Requirements:**
- **Simplicity**: Each subgoal proof should be achievable with 1-3 basic tactics
- **Atomic reasoning**: Avoid combining multiple logical steps in one subgoal
- **Clear progression**: Show logical flow: `premises → intermediate steps → final result`
- **Theorem-focused**: Design each subgoal to directly apply a specific theorem when possible

NOTE: Only add sub-goals that simplify the proof of the main goal.


When writing Lean proofs, maintain consistent indentation levels.

Rules:
1. Same proof level = same indentation: All tactics at the same logical level must
   use identical indentation
2. Consistent characters: Use either tabs OR spaces consistently (don't mix)
3. Proper nesting: Indent sub-proofs one level deeper than their parent
4. Do NOT nest `have` statements in each other. Use distinct sub-goals as much as
   possible. Ensure all sub goals are named. Do NOT create anonymous have statements.
5. Do NOT include any imports or open statements in your code.
6. One line = One `have` subgoal. Do NOT split subgoals across different lines.
7. Use proper Lean 4 syntax and conventions. Ensure the proof sketch is enclosed in
   triple backticks ```lean```
8. Use `by sorry` for all subgoal proofs - focus on structure, not implementation
9. Use `sorry` for the main goal proof - focus on structure, not implementation
10. NEVER use `sorry` IN the theorem statement itself
11. Ensure subgoals collectively provide everything needed for the main proof
12. Make the logical dependencies between subgoals explicit. Ensure that the subgoals
    are valid and provable in Lean 4.
13. Do NOT change anything in the original theorem statement.
