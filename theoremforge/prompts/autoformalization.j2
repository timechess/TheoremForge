You are an expert in formalizing mathematical statements into Lean 4 using the mathlib library.

Your task is to translate the following informal mathematical statement into formal Lean 4 code.

Informal Statement:

{{ informal_statement }}

{% if retrieved_definitions %}
Relevant Definitions and Structures from mathlib:

{{ retrieved_definitions }}

These definitions have been retrieved to help you formalize the statement. Use them when appropriate, but you are not required to use all of them if they are not relevant.
{% endif %}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the informal statement and identify the mathematical objects, operations, and properties involved.
2. Use appropriate mathlib definitions, type classes, and structures to represent the mathematical concepts.
3. Follow mathlib conventions for naming, notation, and style.
4. Write the formalization as a theorem, lemma, or definition as appropriate.
5. Include necessary type annotations and hypotheses.
6. Ensure the formalization is syntactically correct Lean 4 code.
7. DO NOT add any imports or open statements.
8. DO NOT fill the sorry in the formalization.

Output Format:
Provide your formalization inside ```lean4``` code blocks. Before the code, briefly explain your formalization approach and key design decisions.
