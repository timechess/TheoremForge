Complete the following Lean 4 code:

```lean4
{{ formal_statement }}
```

Before producing the Lean 4 code to formally prove the given theorem, provide a detailed proof plan outlining the main proof steps and strategies.
The plan should highlight key ideas, intermediate lemmas, and proof structures that will guide the construction of the final formal proof.
If the given statement contains definitions, include the definitions in the final proof.

Tactic Hint:
- Use `norm_num` for arithmetic operations. Example: To prove `√144 = 12`.
- Use `monicity` to prove that a polynomial is monic and `compute_degree` to solve polynomial degree relevant problems.
