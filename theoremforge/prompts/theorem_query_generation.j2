You are helping solve a Lean theorem proving problem using the mathlib library.
Before attempting to write the proof, you must first search for relevant theorems and tactics.

Search Process:
1. Identify key concepts: Break down the problem into mathematical concepts, operations, and structures involved.
2. Generate search queries: For each concept, create informal search strings that describe:
   - Relevant theorems or results (e.g., "associativity of addition", "existence of inverse elements")
   - Useful tactics (e.g., "simplify arithmetic expressions", "split conjunctions")
   - Properties (e.g., "group structure on integers", "metric space properties")
   - Relevant definitions useful for the proof or any used theorem (e.g. "definition of a group", "definition of a metric space")

Search Query Format:
Enclose each search query in <search> tags with your informal description. Limit yourself to a maximum of 5 search queries. Make the search queries concise and clear. You do not need to emphasize "Lean" or "mathlib" in the search queries.

Guidelines:
- You can either search by theorem name or natural language description
- Search for theorems that might automate parts of the proof
- Consider edge cases and special conditions mentioned in the problem
