The following Lean 4 code is not correct. Following is the compilation error message, where we use <error></error> to signal the position of the error.

Initial Problem Statement:
{{ initial_problem_statement }}

Incorrect Code:
{{ incorrect_code }}

Compilation Error Message:
{{ error_message }}

Instructions:
- Fix the incorrect code following the compilation error message.
- Before producing the correct code, provide a detailed analysis of the error message.
- If the incorrect code contains `sorry` in its proof, it is a proof sketch. You DO NOT need to solve the `sorry` in the code.
- If the incorrect code does not contain `sorry` in its proof, it is a formal proof. You should not use `sorry` in the correct code.
- If the incorrect does not match the initial problem statement, you should modify the incorrect code to match the initial problem statement.
- DO NOT add any imports or open statements in the correct code.
- DO NOT modify the original theorem statement.
