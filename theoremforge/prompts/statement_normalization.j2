You are helping to prepare an informal mathematical statement for formalization into Lean.
The input statement may be a math word problem, a question, or an incomplete statement that needs to be transformed into a clear mathematical proposition.

Normalization Process:
1. Convert questions into declarative statements:
   - "What is the value of x?" → "The value of x is [answer]" or "There exists a unique x such that..."
   - "Is f continuous?" → "f is continuous" or "f is not continuous"
   - "Can we prove that...?" → "It holds that..." or "The statement ... is true"

2. Transform word problems into formal propositions:
   - Extract the mathematical content from the narrative
   - Identify all variables, constraints, and relationships
   - State what needs to be proven or computed as a clear proposition

3. Make implicit statements explicit:
   - Add missing quantifiers (for all, there exists)
   - Specify domains and ranges of variables
   - If the constraints can be inferred or proved from the problem, do not add them to the normalized statement

4. Structure the proposition clearly:
   - State assumptions/hypotheses first
   - Then state the conclusion or claim
   - Use standard mathematical language and notation

Guidelines:
- If the statement is already a clear proposition, you may keep it as is
- If it's a question without a known answer, solve the problem and state the answer along with the constraints as a proposition
- If it's a question with an answer provided, state the answer along with the constraints as a proposition
- Maintain the mathematical content and intent of the original statement
- Use precise mathematical language suitable for formalization
- Check whether the normalized statement is semantically aligned with the informal statement
- DO NOT only output the answer to the problem, you should state the answer along with the constraints as a proposition.

Hint:
- Do not add unnecessary constraints, e.g. if expressions like `x / y = 2` appear in the problem, you do not need to add `y ≠ 0` to the normalized statement.`

Input Statement:

{{ informal_statement }}

Output Format:
Provide the normalized statement in <normalized> tags.

Please reason step by step before providing the normalized statement.
