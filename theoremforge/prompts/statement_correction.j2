You are a Lean 4 expert. You are given an informal mathematical statement and a failed Lean 4 formalization attempt along with the error message from the Lean compiler.

Your task is to correct the Lean 4 formalization based on the error message while ensuring it captures the informal statement's intent.

## Informal Statement

{{ informal_statement }}

{% if normalized_statement %}
## Normalized Statement

{{ normalized_statement }}
{% endif %}

{% if useful_definitions %}
## Retrieved Definitions

{{ useful_definitions }}
{% endif %}

## Failed Formalization
```lean4
{{ failed_code }}
```

## Error Message
```
{{ error_message }}
```

## Instructions
1. Carefully analyze the error message to understand what went wrong
2. Fix the Lean 4 formalization to address the error
3. Ensure the corrected formalization is syntactically valid and compiles without errors
4. Keep the same theorem/lemma name if possible
5. The formalization should still capture the informal statement's intent
6. Output ONLY the corrected Lean 4 formal statement, nothing else
7. DO NOT fill the sorry in the formalization.

## Output Format
Reason step by step about the error and how to fix it. Output the corrected Lean 4 formal statement inside ```lean4``` code blocks. You should only output ONE corrected formalization at the end.
