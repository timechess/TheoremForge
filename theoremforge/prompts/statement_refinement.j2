You are a Lean 4 expert. You are given an informal mathematical statement and its formalization in Lean 4, along with a hint for how to modify the formalization.

Your task is to modify the Lean 4 formalization according to the given hint while ensuring it remains valid and captures the informal statement's intent.

## Informal Statement

{{ informal_statement }}

{% if normalized_statement %}
## Normalized Statement

{{ normalized_statement }}
{% endif %}

{% if useful_definitions %}
## Retrieved Definitions

{{ useful_definitions }}
{% endif %}

## Current Formalization
```lean4
{{ failed_code }}
```

## Modification Hint
1. Check whether the normalized statement contains additional constraints that are not present in the informal statement.
   (e.g. if the problem says `x / y = 2`, do not add `y ≠ 0` to the formalization.)
2. Check whether the formalization uses too general definitions that are hard to compute while the informal statement does not require it. (e.g. `Euclidean.dist` in real space, general `Field` instead of `ℚ`, `Filter.Tendsto` instead of ε-δ definition.)
3. If the problem asks for a solution, the formal statement should use the conditions to derive the solution instead of verifying the solution. (e.g. if the problem is to solve `x ^ 2 - 1 = 0`, the formalization should be `x ^ 2 - 1 = 0 -> x = 1 or x = -1` instead of `x = 1 or x = -1 -> x ^ 2 - 1 = 0`)
3. Remove the comments in the formalization.
4. If the informal statement asks for a concrete solution and the normalized statement only captures the universal property, you need to make the formalization reveal the concrete solution.
5. If the problem needs `largest` or `smallest` element, the formal statement should clarify this property.
6. If the formalization is correct, you can just output the formalization as is.

## Instructions
1. Carefully read and understand the modification hint
2. Modify the Lean 4 formalization according to the hint
3. Ensure the modified formalization is syntactically valid and compiles without errors
4. Keep the same theorem/lemma name if possible
5. The formalization should still capture the informal statement's intent
6. Output ONLY the modified Lean 4 formal statement, nothing else
7. DO NOT fill the sorry in the formalization.
8. DO NOT remove necessary hypotheses or conclusions in the formalization.
9. DO NOT modify according to facts that need reasoning, keep the statement aligned with the informal statement.

Lean Hint:
- For `Complex`, use `‖ · ‖` instead of `Complex.abs`.

## Output Format
Reason step by step before providing the modified Lean 4 formal statement. Output the modified Lean 4 formal statement inside ```lean4``` code blocks. You should only output ONE corrected formalization at the end.
