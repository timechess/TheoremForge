Informal Proof:

{{ informal_proof }}

Task:
Generate a complete, syntactically correct proof for this theorem in Lean 4.

Instructions:
1. Analyze the statement and identify the mathematical objects and properties involved.
2. Determine the appropriate proof strategy (direct proof, induction, cases, etc.).
3. Use appropriate Lean 4 tactics and theorems from Mathlib.
4. Consider using the theorems listed above if they are relevant to the proof.
5. Use the informal proof as a guide to help you construct the proof.
6. Ensure the proof is complete and syntactically correct.
7. DO NOT use `sorry` in your proof.
