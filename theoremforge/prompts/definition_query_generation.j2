You are helping formalize an informal mathematical statement into Lean using the mathlib library.
Before attempting to write the formalization, you must first search for relevant definitions and structures.

Search Process:
1. Identify key concepts: Break down the informal statement into mathematical objects, operations, and properties involved.
2. Generate search queries: For each concept, create informal search strings that describe:
   - Mathematical structures and type classes (e.g., "group", "topological space", "metric space")
   - Definitions of operations (e.g., "definition of matrix multiplication", "definition of limit")
   - Definitions of properties (e.g., "continuity", "injectivity", "completeness")
   - Notation and conventions (e.g., "natural number notation", "function composition")

Search Query Format:
Enclose each search query in <search> tags with your informal description. Limit yourself to a maximum of 5 search queries. Make the search queries concise and clear. You do not need to emphasize "Lean" or "mathlib" in the search queries.

Guidelines:
- You can search by definition name or natural language description
- Focus on finding the correct type classes and structures to use
- Look for standard mathlib conventions and idiomatic ways to express concepts
- Consider how mathlib typically formalizes similar mathematical objects
